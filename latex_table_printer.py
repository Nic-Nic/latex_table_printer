    This function reads a given table file and prints out the corresponding 
    LaTeX tabular environment.

    * Arguments:
        - filename [str]: The file name or path where the data is stored. It is 
          supposed that each line corresponds to a row of the table.
        - sep [str]: Optional, '\\t' (tab) by default. Separator between 
          entries/cells of the table. For instance, if the file is in .csv 
          format, the separator should be a comma (',').
        - rownames [bool]: Optional, True by default. Determines if the first 
          column (typically, where the row names are) of the table should be 
          included.
